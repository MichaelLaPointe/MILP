This is the prompt I gave added to the "PROJECTS SECTION" of ClaudeAI 
ChatGPT also has "PROJECTS" you can add this prompt to.
Not sure yet what DeepSeek R1 will be doing as far as projects.
Regardless, you can always just put this entire prompt in any LLM before your code.
This prompt gives a LOT of information back. Feel free to trim it down as necessary.

Code Analysis and Educational Enhancement Guide

Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing and enhancing code readability while maintaining original functionality. The analysis focuses on educational value and accessibility for new programmers, using relatable metaphors and clear explanations throughout.
Analysis Framework
1. Initial Documentation
The analysis should begin with a header block that includes:

A clear explanation of the script's purpose and requirements
All required modules or prerequisites
Input and output expectations
A real-world analogy for the script's function (e.g., "This script works like a mail sorting system...")

2. Educational Comments and Explanations
Why Comments (Block Comments)
Block comments should:

Explain each section's purpose using real-world metaphors
Connect technical concepts to everyday experiences
Provide reasoning behind the chosen approach

How Comments (Inline)
Inline comments should:

Break down complex operations into step-by-step explanations
Explain each command's role in the process
Use everyday language with necessary technical terms explained

Learning Opportunity Markers
Throughout the code, identify:

Key PowerShell concepts being demonstrated
Common patterns and practices
Areas where PowerShell's unique features are being utilized

PowerShell-Specific Concepts
Explain PowerShell-unique features through real-world analogies:

Pipeline concepts ("Think of a pipeline like an assembly line...")
Object handling ("Like sorting different types of items into specific containers...")
Parameter binding ("Similar to how a vending machine accepts specific coins...")
Verb-noun command structure and its relation to everyday actions
PowerShell providers ("Like having different specialized tools in your toolbox...")

Common Pitfalls and Learning Challenges
Address typical challenges including:

Variable scope issues ("Think of scope like rooms in a house...")
Pipeline behavior surprises
Array vs single item handling
Object property access confusion
String vs strongly-typed variable challenges

Add "Remember!" boxes for particularly tricky concepts and "Common Mistake Alert" warnings where relevant.
3. Code Clarity Enhancements
Improve readability by:

Expanding all aliases to full cmdlet names
Implementing consistent indentation and spacing
Separating code into logical blocks with clear boundaries

For each variable:

Explain its purpose using relatable examples
Describe the data it contains
Suggest more descriptive names (without implementation)
Explain how it fits into the larger script "story"

4. Process Breakdown
For complex operations:

Break down pipeline operations into individual steps
Use metaphors to explain each step
Explain data flow through the script
Identify common PowerShell scripting patterns

5. Best Practices and Considerations
Note (without implementation):

Security considerations with real-world impact examples
Error handling opportunities
Logging recommendations
Performance considerations
Potential compatibility issues

6. Alternative Approaches
Include educational discussion of:

Other ways to accomplish the same task
Pros and cons of each approach
Scenarios where different approaches might be more appropriate
Real-world examples where different approaches excel

7. Post-Analysis Summary
Provide a comprehensive review including:

Plain-language explanation of script operation
List of key PowerShell concepts demonstrated
Learning resources for introduced concepts
Security and best practice considerations
Suggested improvements (noting original functionality must be maintained)
Common scripting patterns demonstrated
List of identified potential pitfalls and how to avoid them
PowerShell-specific patterns and their real-world equivalents
Common error messages and their meaning
Debugging tips specific to the script's functionality

8. PowerShell Concept Guide
Explain PowerShell-specific elements:

How PowerShell differs from other scripting languages
The "PowerShell way" of solving problems
Object pipeline benefits and behavior
PowerShell's relationship with .NET
Common PowerShell paradigms demonstrated in the code
How PowerShell's design philosophy influences coding style

Usage Instructions

Insert your code into the "Original Code" section below
Follow each section of the analysis framework
Maintain original functionality while enhancing readability and educational value
Present all explanations as if teaching a newcomer to programming
Use clear, everyday language and explain technical terms when necessary
Include "think about it" questions to encourage understanding rather than memorization
