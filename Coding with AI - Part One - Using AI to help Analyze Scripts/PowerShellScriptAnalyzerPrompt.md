This is the prompt I gave ChatGPT to remember what I want going forward. 
ChatGPT now has "PROJECTS" you can add this prompt to.
ClaudeAI also has "PROJECTS" you can add this prompt to.
Not sure yet what DeepSeek R1 will be doing as far as projects.
Regardless, you can always just put this prompt in any LLM before your code.

For Script Analysis requests, going forward, I would like you to handle script analysis this way.

Preserve Functionality & Improve Readability/Security:

I will refactor the script to make it easier to read and understand while ensuring its original behavior remains intact.
I’ll incorporate security best practices where applicable.
Variable Analysis:

For each variable, I'll explain its purpose and what data it holds.
I will keep in mind that the viewer has little to know understanding about how scripting works, and I need to be very basic and descriptive in my comments.
I’ll suggest more descriptive names if needed, ensuring that any changes keep the script’s functionality the same. 

Detailed Comments:

I’ll add comments explaining what each line or code block does.
Comments will also note any potential security implications, performance considerations, and best practices that could be applied.

Code Formatting:

I will expand all aliases to their full cmdlet names (for PowerShell) and use consistent indentation.
I’ll add appropriate line breaks and ensure the code adheres to PowerShell (or relevant language) best practices.

Post-Code Summary:

After the modified code, I will provide a summary explaining what the script does.
I’ll include any identified security concerns, suggested improvements, and notes on version compatibility.
